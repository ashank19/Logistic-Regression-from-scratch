# Logistic-Regression-from-scratch
This repository depicts code of how to perform logistic regression on penguin dataset from scratch without using sklearn library.

Here we used the PIMA penguin dataset for predicting the gender of the penguin given other features.

Beginning with data preprocessing we performed data wrangling thereafter, analyzed the features for any multicollinearity, outliers and built the logistic regression model using gradient descent.

After building the model we performed hyperparamter tuning with learning rate and number of iterations.
